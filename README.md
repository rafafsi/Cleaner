# Cleaner

The initial goal of this project is to assist the organization of an amateur soccer that takes place in Recife (at a location called JetClube). The list list of participants is updated via a WhatsApp group, and it needs to be clean so that we can separate the teams. In the following steps, I want to implement a separator that assigns each player a ranking in order to level up the game.

I hope you enjoy it!
